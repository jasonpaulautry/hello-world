My first repository

To whomever found this lonely spot,

I'm a higher education professional whose accidentally found his way into this career. 
I pursued an English Lit degree because nothing else was working out, I enjoy writing and I hated books. 
Long story there. I got a Masters in Education because I loved working with students but didn't know you could make a career of it. 
Now, I'm in my mid-30s and I know I have an endless curiosity for data, design, analog games, and learning. 
And that's why I'm here.
